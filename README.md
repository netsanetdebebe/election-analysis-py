Election analysis project
Overall objective of this analysis 
The overall objective of this assignment was providing additional and more succinct results from the analysis of the election data for the election commission.   

Specific objectives 
The assignment has three components. The first part of the assignment required working on the dataset and report specific results on counties and candidates. Specifics were that the election commission requested some additional data for an audit on voter turnout for each county (Jefferson, Denver, and Arapahoe); percentage of votes for each county; and report the county with the highest turnout. The second part of the assignment required reporting of the results both for the candidates and the counties on a text file. The third component of the assignment was generating a written report of the analysis process and the results. 

Executed/methods 
To find the requested results for the commission, Python and VS Code were used to add code and analyze the data. Conditional statements with membership and logical operators and for loops were used. Also, repetition statements, conditional statements with logical operators, and print statements, were run to print out the candidate and county election results to the command line. 
Results
-	In this congressional election, a total of 369, 711 votes were cast 
-	A breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes is presented as follows: Arapahoe: 6.7% (24,801); Denver: 82.8% (306,055); Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855) 
-	Denver county has the largest number of votes (306,055)
-	Here is a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received: 
o	Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
o	Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)
o	Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)
-	The winner of the election is Diana DeGette with a total of 272,892 votes, which is 73.8% of the votes 

Summary 
This script and the analysis process could be used to analyze other similar election data and do auditing. With edits to some unique information to the current congressional election, the code could be run to analyze other similar datasets.
